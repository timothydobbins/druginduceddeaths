These data are provided by the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/) (ABS) using data from the National Coronial Information System. Changes in data coding and collection have occurred over the time period reported.

The ABS undertakes a revision process for coroner certified deaths over a 3 year period; accordingly, data for 2015 and 2016 are not final. These figures should be viewed in conjunction with the ABS [Explanatory Notes 50-58](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3303.0Explanatory%20Notes12016?OpenDocument).

In addition to the revisions process, the ABS undertook further processing improvements from 2008 onwards.  For both open and closed cases, the ABS increasingly use additional information on the NCIS (e.g. autopsy, police and toxicology reports), where available, to apply more specific cause of death codes. These processing improvements are likely to have an impact on the number of drug-induced deaths reported from 2008 onwards. 

In 2014, the ABS implemented IRIS, an automatic system for coding multiple causes of death and selecting the underlying cause of death. Impacts on the data from 2013 onwards are described in more detail in the ABS [Technical Note 1, Causes of Death Australia 2013](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3303.0Technical%20Note12013?opendocument&tabname=Notes).

It should also be noted that availability of additional information on the NCIS varies by jurisdiction and means that improvements are likely to be applied differentially across jurisdictions.

### Terminology

Deaths are considered ‘drug-induced deaths’ if they are directly attributable to drug use (e.g. drug overdose is the underlying cause of death). They are considered ‘drug-related deaths’ where drugs played a contributory role and the death was attributable another cause (e.g. motor vehicle accident).  

The opioid deaths presented here are ‘opioid-induced deaths’, i.e. they are attributable to overdose. The amphetamine deaths presented include ‘amphetamine-induced deaths’, i.e. attributable to amphetamine toxicity, and ‘any mention’ deaths, where amphetamines were considered to play a contributory role. The ‘amphetamine any mention deaths’ include deaths attributable to amphetamine toxicity, and deaths where amphetamines played a contributory role. The cocaine deaths follow the same logic as the amphetamine deaths.

### Intent

As part of the coronial investigation of drug-related deaths, the coroner assigns the manner of intent to these deaths, where there is sufficient information.  The ICD-10AM coding incorporates codes for the following categories of intent:

1. accidental intent, where the coroner determines the manner/intent of the injury or poisoning which led to death was accidental;
1. intentional, where the coroner determines that the manner/intent of the injury or poisoning which led to death was purposeful; and 
1. undetermined, where there was insufficient information for the coroner to make a determination on the intent.  

Opioid-induced deaths are presented by these three categories of intent, where numbers permit, and by all intents.  Amphetamine and cocaine deaths are presented by accidental intent, and all intents, as there are very few of these deaths that are determined to be intentional.
