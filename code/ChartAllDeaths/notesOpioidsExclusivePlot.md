Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.

These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to illicit opioids (predominantly heroin), opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to pharmaceutical opioids (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioid analgesics), and opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both illicit and pharmaceutical opioids.
