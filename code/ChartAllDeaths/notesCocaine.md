The following ICD-10 codes have been used to examine deaths where cocaine was considered to be the underlying cause of death – ‘cocaine-induced deaths’:
- F14 - Accidental deaths due to cocaine use disorder (including cocaine dependence).
-	X42 with T40.5 - Accidental deaths due to poisoning cross-classified with cocaine poisoning (but excluding any other drug from the X42 category).
-	X42 with F14 - Accidental deaths due to poisoning cross-classified with cocaine use disorder (including cocaine dependence).

The following ICD-10 codes have been used to examine deaths in which cocaine was mentioned as a contributing cause of a drug-induced death, but in which it may not have been the primary cause of death – ‘drug-induced deaths with cocaine contributing’.  It should be noted that figures presented for ‘drug-indcued deaths with cocaine contributing’ also include the deaths where cocaine was the underlying cause of  (‘cocaine-induced’) death:
-	F14 with (F11-F16, F19, X40-X44) - Accidental deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine use disorder (including cocaine dependence).
-	T40.5 with (F11-F16, F19, X40-X44) – Accidental deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine poisoning.
-	F14 with (F11-F16, F19, X60-X64) - Intentional deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine use disorder (including cocaine dependence).
-	T40.5 with (F11-F16, F19, X60-X64) – Intentional deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine poisoning.
-	F14 with (F11-F16, F19, Y10-Y14) – Deaths of undetermined intent due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine use disorder (including cocaine dependence).
-	T40.5 with (F11-F16, F19, Y10-Y14) – Deaths of undetermined intent due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with cocaine poisoning.
