ICD-10 uses the terminology “amphetamine” to refer to the drug class that includes “methamphetamine”. We use consistent terminology when presenting the data.

The following ICD-10 codes have been used to examine deaths where amphetamines were considered to be the underlying cause of death – ‘amphetamine-induced deaths’:
-	X41 with F15 - Accidental deaths due to poisoning cross-classified with amphetamine use disorder (including amphetamine dependence)
-	X41 with T43.6 - Accidental deaths due to poisoning cross-classified with amphetamine poisoning (but excluding any other drug from the X41 category).

The following ICD-10 codes have been used to examine deaths in which amphetamines were mentioned as a contributing cause of a drug-induced death, but in which they may not have been the primary cause of death – ‘drug-induced deaths with amphetamines contributing’. It should be noted that figures presented for ‘drug-induced deaths with amphetamines contributing’ also include the deaths where amphetamines were the underlying cause of (‘amphetamine-induced’) death: 
-	F15 with (F11-F16, F19, X40-X44) - Accidental deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine use disorder (including amphetamine dependence).
-	T43.6 with (F11-F16, F19, X40-X44) – Accidental deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine poisoning.
-	F15 with (F11-F16, F19, X60-X64) - Intentional deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine use disorder (including amphetamine dependence).
-	T43.6 with (F11-F16, F19, X60-X64) – Intentional deaths due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine poisoning.
-	F15 with (F11-F16, F19, Y10-Y14) – Deaths of undetermined intent due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine use disorder (including amphetamine dependence).
-	T43.6 with (F11-F16, F19, Y10-Y14) – Deaths of undetermined intent due to multiple and other drug use disorder cross-classified with amphetamine poisoning.
